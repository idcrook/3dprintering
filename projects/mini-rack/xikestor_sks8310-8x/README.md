## Ears for 10-inch rackmount

The mounts on the switch are symmetrical and so are the ears. So print two of the included 10-inch ear model (one for each side). Made countersink holes, so the screw head can be flush with ear bracket.

Also needed:

- `6` count of `M3 8mm` screws
  - The `M3 5mm` screws that came with the switch for the included 19-inch rackmount metal ears aren't long enough for the 3D-printed ears, since the plastic ear is thicker than the metal ear.
