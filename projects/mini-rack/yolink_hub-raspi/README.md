# 10-inch rackmount to accomodate side-by-side yolink smart hub and Raspberry Pi model B with audio cable

Wanted to use in my 10-inch rack setup. Adapted from [Raspberry Pi 2B/3B/4B/5B 10-inch Rack Mount by Maurício Pessoa](https://www.printables.com/model/1185545-raspberry-pi-2b3b4b5b-10-inch-rack-mount/files) and sized out in OpenSCAD to ascertain the two devices would fit and not interfere with rack or otherwise. For now, just placing yolink hub in area where a raspi would go. may create a proper mount in the future.
