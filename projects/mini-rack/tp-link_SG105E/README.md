# TP-LINK TL-SG105E (Ver. 3.0)

![mockup](muckup.png)

Wanted to use in my 10-inch rack setup since I need the extra space under the Pi for an errant tall PoE HAT in a 1U rack below where this rack will be installed.

## Differences

 - Repaired the .STL mesh (using PrusaSlicer) so that OpenSCAD could be used to remix
 - Trimmed walls above and around cooling areas in rear of switch enclosure
 - Added half-cross mount screw hole outlines (switch rests on its cutouts)
 - Shrunk bores on M2.5 pi mount posts ever so slightly
