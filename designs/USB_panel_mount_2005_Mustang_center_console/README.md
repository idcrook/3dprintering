# Panel Cover for USB socket mount in 2005 Ford Mustang

A replacement for factory "blank" cover mount in center console storage compartment in a 2005 Ford Mustang. It was created to hold USB socket for a new car stereo install.

# TODO

 1. Get socket to snap fit. It is currently modeled to similar dimensions as bracket that cable came with. This means the "cigarette lighter" hole is too small for a flush-at-surface mount.

## Reference

  - [USB cable]() bought on Amazon
  - Ford part number that is substitute for: []()

## Methodology

I took measurements of the Ford plastic part being replaced as well as a desktop mount that came with the USB cable kit.

I modeled the replacement part in Autodesk Fusion 360.

  - For iterative prototyping, printed in PLA on Lulzbot Mini (at "fast" setting)
  - For final print, printed in ABS on Lulzbot Mini (no rescaling, at "detailed" setting)
